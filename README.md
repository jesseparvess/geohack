# MIT-808 - SDG Goals

## About

This repository handles the MIT 808 data science project. Specifically it concerns the South African SDG Hub.

The website of the South African SDG Hub can be found here: https://sasdghub.up.ac.za

Here the South African SDG Hub has created a metadatabase that contains paper abstracts, along with paper titles, and the associated classification of the article to a SDG goal. The aim of this project is to create a search engine that returns the most appropriate articles based on a user query. The returned results must be more relevant than the current search engine and be able to be visualized in a manner that improves user accessibility to the papers retrieved.

In exploratory data analysis (under notebooks) the data base is explored and analysed.

In modeling (under notebooks) the search engine is defined and tested.
